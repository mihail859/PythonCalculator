Calculator Program Documentation

Introduction:
The Calculator Program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python's `tkinter` library. It provides basic arithmetic and scientific calculations to help users perform mathematical operations conveniently.

Features:
- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Clear and backspace functionality.
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.

User Interface:
- Entry field: Allows users to input numbers and mathematical expressions.
- Buttons: Provides buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, and other functions.
- Result display: Displays the calculated result or error messages.

Usage:
1. Run the Calculator Program.
2. Input numbers and operations using the buttons or the keyboard.
3. Click on the "=" button to calculate and display the result.
4. Use the "Clear" button to clear the input field.

Plan to Build Calculator Program:
1. Design the User Interface:
   - Sketch out the layout of buttons, entry field, and result display.
   - Organize buttons logically and group similar operations.

2. Set Up the GUI:
   - Import the `tkinter` library.
   - Create the main application window and set its title.

3. Create UI Elements:
   - Add an entry field for input.
   - Create buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, and functions.

4. Implement Basic Operations:
   - Set up functions to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Bind these functions to their respective buttons.

5. Add Scientific Operations:
   - Implement functions for square root and exponentiation.
   - Create buttons for these scientific functions.

7. Update Display:
   - Update the entry field or display area with the calculated result or error message.

8. Clear and Backspace:
   - Implement functions to clear the input field and remove the last entered character.

9. Keyboard Input:
   - Bind keyboard keys to appropriate functions for numeric and operational input.

10. User Testing:
  	- Test the calculator program with various inputs and operations.
    	- Check for correctness, error handling, and user experience.
